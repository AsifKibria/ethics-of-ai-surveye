                  <h4>PROS</h4>
                  <p><strong>Economic:</strong> Compared with other types of security measures such as fingerprints, facial recognition requires fewer human resources.</p>
                  <p><strong>Non-contact:</strong>The user can obtain the image without direct contact with the device, which is clean and hygienic, and avoids the possible contact and transmission of diseases.</p>
                  <p><strong>Convenience:</strong>When shopping in the supermarket, it is more efficient to use face brushing payment. In this website, without any operation, we can realize face recognition while answering questions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Easy to detect:</strong>A surprising use of facial recognition technology is to detect genetic diseases. For example, in some cases, facial recognition software can determine how a particular gene mutation causes a particular syndrome. In this website, we can directly detect the user's emotion and the authenticity of the answer through the user's smile.</p>
                  <p><strong>Safety:</strong>Law enforcement agencies use the technology to uncover criminals or to find missing children or seniors. Some business owners are installing facial-recognition systems to watch people and identify subjects of interest when they come in their stores.When people know they are being watched, they are less likely to commit crimes so the possibility of facial recognition technology being used could deter crime.</p>
                  <p><strong>High Accuracy:</strong>The success rate is currently at a high due to the developments of 3D facial recognition technologies and infrared cameras. The combination of these technologies make it very hard to trick the system.  </p>
              </li>
              <li class="feature-2">
                  <h4>CONS</h4>
                  <p><strong>Variability:</strong>In different viewing angles, the visual images of human faces are also very different. (Easily affected by light conditions, such as strong light and dark night)</p>
                  <p><strong>Conceability:</strong>The face can be concealed artificially to make it impossible to detect data. (Many coverings on the human face: such as masks, sunglasses, hair, beards, etc.)</p>
                  <p><strong>Authenticity:</strong>The user may perform facial recognition through images such as photos and videos, instead of the actual facial recognition.</p>
                  <p><strong>Privacy:</strong>Data is used for various commercial purposes, and even used for fraud by criminals.</p>
                  <p><strong>Infringement:</strong>Large-scale social networking sites perform biometric identification and analysis of users without their consent. For example: Facebook face recognition technology infringement case.</p>
                  <p><strong>Data storage:</strong>Any form of data needs to be effectively stored, and the storage space for face recognition will be larger. However, this obstacle will remain until the technology develops significantly.</p>
