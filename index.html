                  <h4>PROS</h4>
                  <p><strong>Economic</strong></p>
                    <p>Compared with other types of security measures such as fingerprints, facial recognition requires fewer human resources. 
                        <a href= "https://becominghuman.ai/the-threats-and-benefits-of-facial-recognition-what-should-we-know-17008f69ae74">Further read</a></p>                    
                  <p><strong>Contactless</strong></p>
                    <p>The user can obtain the image without direct contact with the device, which is clean, hygienic and avoids possible contact and therefore transmission of diseases.

                    </p>
                  <p><strong>Convenience</strong></p>
                    <p>The convenience of facial recognition extends beyond security too. Instead of making purchases at stores with cash or credit cards, facial recognition technology can recognize your face and charge the goods to your account.
                        <a href= "https://www.itpro.com/security/privacy/356882/the-pros-and-cons-of-facial-recognition-technology">Further read</a>
                    </p>
                  <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
                    <p>Law enforcement agencies use the technology to uncover criminals or to find missing people. When people know they are being observed, they are less likely to commit crimes, so the possibility of facial recognition technology being used could deter crime.

                    </p>
                  <p><strong>High Accuracy</strong></p>
                    <p>The success rate is currently improving due to the developments of 3D facial recognition technologies and infrared cameras. The combination of these technologies make it very hard to trick the system. Especially some facial micro expressions of people are often difficult to hide.

                  <h4>CONS</h4>
                  <p><strong>Variability</strong></p>
                    <p>In different points of view, the visual images of human faces are also very different. They are also easily affected by light conditions, such as strong light and dark night.
                        <a href= "https://becominghuman.ai/the-threats-and-benefits-of-facial-recognition-what-should-we-know-17008f69ae74">Further read</a>
                    </p>
                  <p><strong>Conceability</strong></p>
                    <p>The face can be concealed artificially to make it impossible to detect data. It’s easily possible to alter the face through coverings on the human face, such as masks, sunglasses, hair, beards, etc.

                    </p>
                  <p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p>
                    <p>The user may perform facial recognition through images such as photos and videos, instead of the actual facial recognition.

                  <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
                    <p>Some say that using face recognition is the same as taking your DNA samples or fingerprints without you knowing about it. Face recognition enables mass identification by governments. Without proper limits, some worry about the abuse of privacy rights. For example, stored data may get in the wrong hands, which helps with identity theft.

                  <p><strong>Infringement</strong></p>
                    <p>Large-scale social networking sites perform biometric identification and analysis of users without their consent. For example: Facebook face recognition technology infringement case.

                  <p><strong>Data storage</strong></p>
                    <p>Any form of data needs to be effectively stored, and the demand for storage space for face recognition will increase. However, this obstacle will remain until the technology develops significantly.

                  <p><strong>Racial Discrimination</strong></p>
                    <p>The technology isn’t as effective at identifying people of color and women as it is white males. A growing body of research exposes divergent error rates across demographic groups, with the poorest accuracy consistently found in subjects who are female, black, and 18-30 years old. In a criminal justice setting, face recognition technologies that are inherently biased in their accuracy can misidentify suspects, incarcerating innocent Black Americans.
